## Introduction

Transfer learning is a powerful method in machine learning where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. This technique is particularly useful in computer vision where deep learning models require large datasets and substantial computational resources to train.

In this project, we use MobileNet, a lightweight deep learning model, to classify images from a custom dataset. The notebook walks through the steps of data preprocessing, model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the ETH-80 dataset, which includes various images categorized into different classes.

### Dataset Information

- **Source:** [ETH-80 Dataset](https://github.com/sadeepj/eth-80/releases/download/0.0.1/eth-80.tar.gz)
- **Classes:** The dataset contains images of 80 objects grouped into 8 categories: apples, cars, cows, cups, dogs, horses, pears, and tomatoes.
- **Format:** The dataset is provided in a tar.gz archive containing JPEG images.
- **Sample Size:** The dataset includes a total of 3280 images.

Make sure to download the dataset and upload it to your Google Colab environment before running the notebook.
